Even if you are not going to get to know her, it is worth practicing so that when the princess appears, the tongue and brains do not go awry, so that the search for the phrase occurs subconsciously.

If this does not work, then come up with it on the spot, taking into account that the first phrase should be about her, more precisely, a direct or indirect compliment.

At the same time, it is desirable that this be a request, since any person will be flattered if asked for advice. And he will be happy to give advice.

It is necessary to find in the girl something distinctive from others, something that looks beautiful, suits her or is simply original. This can be hair color, hairstyle, lipstick color, blouse, shoes, dress, skirt, unusual colors of clothes, etc.`,

Old Man Golum's main feature was that he had paranoid schizophrenia, complicated by a guilt complex. I mean, he had two "halves" of his personality - dark and light.

In general, the most important feature of Golum was how these halves communicated with each other - they communicated out loud. And now I will offer you to be such an interesting and cool character for a while in order to learn how to turn off your internal dialogue immediately and for a long time.

Ready? We started. The purpose of the exercise. Learn to turn off internal dialogue; creating interest in the girl, working out the communication base, working out the significance of social conventions.

Exercise

You will need to start communicating with the girls, fully and aloud voicing your internal dialogue. The main condition: you need to say everything - both internal dialogue and ordinary words. Even if it is a sentence like “I wonder, does she have a boyfriend? You have a boyfriend?".

Exercise completion criterion

Complete shutdown of internal dialogue in forty-five cases out of fifty (ninety percent convergence).

To complete the exercise completely, you may need a week of one hour a day (seven hours of net time).

This exercise is a real banter. I highly recommend doing it, at least to understand the fact that no one has ever met this girl like that. Do you think this is good or just great?`,

      text: `Exercise objectives

Developing a communicative base, the ability to notice (calibrate) relationships between men and women, the ability to notice (calibrate) relationships within a group.

Basic execution

You need one notebook and a pen (pencil) for writing. You find any couple (man and woman) in any public place and make an assumption for yourself: how long have they known each other? What kind of relationship are they in? How long do they have this stage of the relationship?

For example, they have known each other for one year, have sex with each other, and have been doing it for six months.

You need to write down your assumptions in a notebook, and then go up and check, that is, get confirmation (or refutation) of your assumptions from people.

The following legend can help you

You are a student of the University of Psychology and are preparing for your thesis (credit) work. Depending on your age, you can be either a first-grader * or a seasoned assistant professor (graduate student, professor - insert to taste). To carry out work, you must learn to define relationships between people just by looking at them, and they can help you in your work.

Exercise Criteria

You accurately determine all three parameters (well, with a reasonable tolerance) in forty-five pairs out of fifty, and forty-five pairs out of fifty are talking to you (double ninety percent convergence).

Advanced execution

Everything is the same as in the basic version, only you approach small groups (4-8 people). Determine the quantity for yourself - because this is a very big job that will give you a lot of experience for communicating with groups (and a lot of experience in opening communication with groups).

You will need about two weeks to study, subject to one and a half hours a day (twenty hours of net time).`,

Stop, look the girl in the eyes and say: “Girl, I need help, I WANT YOU AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT! How to deal with this situation? What do you advise? Can I hope for something? "

The purpose of the exercise is to release the clamps in the expression of desire.

The main thing is not to be afraid to show the girl that you really want her! After all, when you learn this maneuver, your confidence will increase a hundred times and you will become much more successful in communicating with women.`,

      text: `Walk up to any girl and use a series of correct questions to figure out what to say. For example: “Hello. Maybe you can help me? " Pause until she responds.
      
Seconds 5. And continue: “You know, everything is already tired, everything is so banal and boring, I looked at you and decided to spit on everything and take you home in order to have group sex with you and your girlfriend! Let's do it! "

Or: “Hello, I saw a rich inner potential in you, tell me, how can you cheer me up? Let's have group sex with you and your friend! And we'll get drunk at the same time, that will be a thrill! "

Or: "How are you going to entertain me?"

This exercise will lead to enlightenment, and you will discover many new things for yourself. You can't even imagine what kind of reaction women will have.

Do it and check it out. The main thing is to do it playfully! The girl will laugh or be embarrassed. Whatever happens, stay playful. And you will find out what to do according to the reaction of the person.

If you feel that her reaction is like a brake, then why do you need it - you have to end up with this.

Say: "It was nice to talk to." And laugh to yourself, so kindly, at her. If the reaction is not what you expected, it is not the same, “these are the wrong bees, they are carrying the wrong honey!” Then go to the next one.

In any case, there are inadequacies, and you can't get away from them. Pay no attention to them.`,

      title: 'Poet',
      text: `An exercise for emancipation, intended for self-development, very enlightening; it is used in most personal growth trainings.

Very common in Japan for sales training and public speaking.

This exercise will well knock all the crap out of you and turn you into a real brave and liberated man. It is especially important to complete it if you have never performed in front of a large audience or you are afraid of the people around you, and the reaction of the people around you is very relevant to you.

Can you read poetry? Great opportunity to learn if not!

The task in which you need:

1. Find a place full of people.

2. Exit to an elevated surface

3. Read the verse. I recommend reading from a piece of paper.

4. Ignore any reactions of the crowd. Both positive and negative. Do not communicate with anyone. Do not be distracted, no matter what happens. You are a robot reading a poem. Your task is to stare at a piece of paper. At any cost, read to the end loudly and expressively!

5. And then just walk away. Not to run away, but calmly, as if nothing had happened to leave.

To be effective, do this exercise for 2 weeks. Once every 2 days.

You will see that after 2 weeks reading poetry on the street will become routine for you.

You should not give a fuck about the reaction of others. Until that happens, practice recitation.`,
